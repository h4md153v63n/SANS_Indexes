# SEC-560-Index
This is an index I created for the SANS 560 course, SEC560.  The columns are Book, Page, Topic.
I found many useful tips on building an index from the reference links below.  I color coded the book with colored tabs
at the top of each book.  These are reflected in the Book and Page columns.  Then on the right side of the book,
I put colored tabs for each section, alternating colors.  This is reflected in the Topic column.  This is a very
high level explanation of my process, but reading the reference links should give you a good understanding of my process.

I have included my index in PDF format along with an image of the tabbed 560 books.
